# Sidebar Recovery Solution

## Problem
When users collapse the Streamlit sidebar in their browser, the collapsed state is stored in the browser's local storage. This means that even after restarting the Streamlit app or rebooting the server, the sidebar remains collapsed for that specific browser.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CSS Styling
- **Multiple CSS selectors** to target different Streamlit versions and class names
- **Forced visibility** with `!important` flags to override browser preferences
- **Visual indicators** when sidebar is collapsed (colored button, menu text)
- **Hover effects** to make the expand button more discoverable

### 2. JavaScript Recovery Script
- **Clears local storage** on page load to prevent permanent collapse
- **Emergency toggle button** appears if sidebar becomes completely inaccessible
- **Monitoring script** that runs every 2 seconds to ensure expand button remains styled
- **Tooltip text** on expand button for user guidance

### 3. User Interface Hints
- **Info message** on student info page explaining how to find the sidebar
- **Collapsible help section** on assignment page with step-by-step instructions
- **Visual cues** in the main content area to guide users

## Key Features

### Robust CSS Targeting
```css
.css-1d391kg, .css-1cypcdb, .css-17eq0hr, section[data-testid="stSidebar"][aria-expanded="false"]
```
Targets multiple possible class names that Streamlit might use across versions.

### Emergency Recovery
- If all CSS fails, JavaScript creates an emergency menu button
- Positioned at top-left of screen with high z-index
- Automatically attempts to trigger sidebar expansion

### Visual Feedback
- Collapsed sidebar shows "ðŸ’¬ Menu" indicator
- Expand button is prominently colored (WHU blue)
- Hover effects provide immediate feedback

## Testing Instructions

1. **Initial Test**: Open app in new browser - sidebar should be visible
2. **Collapse Test**: Click the collapse arrow to hide sidebar
3. **Recovery Test**: Look for the blue button on far left edge
4. **Persistence Test**: Refresh page - sidebar should still be recoverable
5. **Emergency Test**: If expand button fails, emergency menu button should appear

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Primary CSS selectors work
- **Firefox**: Backup selectors and JavaScript recovery
- **Safari**: JavaScript-based recovery as fallback
- **Mobile**: Emergency button provides access if needed

## Maintenance Notes

- CSS selectors may need updates if Streamlit changes their class naming
- JavaScript intervals are set to 2-second monitoring (adjust if needed)
- Emergency button timeout is 1 second after page load (can be adjusted)

## User Instructions

**For Students/Instructors:**
1. If you don't see the sidebar, look for a small colored button on the far left edge
2. Click the blue arrow/button to expand the sidebar
3. The sidebar contains Admin Login and Chatbot features
4. If nothing works, refresh the page - the recovery script will help

This solution ensures that the sidebar is ALWAYS recoverable, regardless of browser local storage or Streamlit version changes.
