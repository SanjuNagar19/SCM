# Dragon Fire Case Updates Summary

## Changes Made to `modules/dragon_fire.py`

### 1. Updated System Context
**Old Context**: Blue Dragon (Austria) → China with coca leaf powder  
**New Context**: Blue Dragon (German startup) → China market entry

**Key Changes**:
- Company origin: Austria → **Germany** (startup)
- Product basis: Coca leaf → **Regular energy drink powder**
- Market strategy: High-end market → **Bars/restaurants only initially** (no supermarkets)
- Pricing: 25 Yuan price → **25 Yuan for bars/restaurants (~3.30€), future 10 Yuan for supermarkets (~1.30€)**
- Product variants: Single product → **Two variants (with sugar and sugar-free)**
- Transportation costs: USD estimates → **Specific Euro costs provided**

### 2. Updated Transportation Costs
**Old**: Estimated ranges in USD  
**New**: Specific costs in Euros
- **Air freight**: €1.50/kg (3 days)
- **Sea freight**: €400 per 40ft container (30 days)  
- **Rail transport**: €3,000 per 40ft container (15 days)

### 3. Updated Assignment Questions

#### Phase 1 Changes:
- Origin: Austria → **Germany**
- Focus: Product characteristics → **Market entry risk analysis**
- Added: Startup risk factors, demand uncertainty considerations
- Container specification: General containers → **40ft containers specifically**

#### Phase 2 Changes:
- Currency: USD calculations → **Euro calculations**
- Decision criteria: General factors → **Startup-specific factors** (financial risk, market uncertainty)
- Transportation costs: Updated to exact Euro amounts provided

#### Phase 3 Changes:
- Target market: General bars/clubs → **Bars/restaurants specifically** (no supermarkets)
- Business context: Established company → **Startup constraints** (budget, cash flow)
- Distribution: General strategy → **Limited channel strategy** focused on initial market

#### Phase 4 Changes:
- Risk context: General supply chain → **Startup-specific risks** (limited resources, cash flow)
- Regulatory scenario: Coca leaf restrictions → **General beverage import regulations**
- Response planning: Corporate response → **Startup survival strategies**

### 4. Updated Disruption Scenarios

#### Scenario 3 (Regulatory Challenge):
- **Old**: "China restricts coca leaf imports" 
- **New**: "China implements new beverage import regulations requiring additional safety testing"
- Impact focus: Product formulation → **Compliance and certification requirements**
- Startup impact: Confiscation risk → **Cash flow and timeline impact**

#### All Scenarios:
- Added startup-specific impacts (cash flow strain, limited resources)
- Emphasized timeline pressure for market launch
- Focus on financial constraints typical of startups

### 5. Context Consistency

The entire module now reflects:
- **German startup** (not Austrian established company)
- **Market entry strategy** (bars/restaurants first, supermarkets later)
- **Two product variants** (with sugar, sugar-free)
- **Startup constraints** (limited budget, unproven market, cash flow concerns)
- **Specific European costs** (in Euros, not USD estimates)

## Impact on Students

1. **More realistic startup scenario** with resource constraints
2. **Specific cost data** for accurate calculations
3. **Market entry focus** rather than established market operations
4. **Risk management** tailored to startup vulnerabilities
5. **Two-phase market strategy** (bars first, supermarkets later)

## Technical Notes

- All functions maintained their signatures for compatibility
- Module imports and exports unchanged
- Integration with backend and app.py preserved
- Calculation functions still work with updated transportation costs

The Dragon Fire case now accurately reflects a German startup's market entry strategy into China with realistic constraints and decision factors.
